            <p>
                Crixen was born from a simple observation: social media growth is hard, but engagement is harder.
                In a world dominated by algorithms, authentic interaction is the only currency that matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                We built Crixen to be the ultimate AI agent for creators and brands. Unlike generic automation tools that spam,
                Crixen understands context, tone, and nuance. It helps you maintain a consistent presence, reply to your community,
                and grow your reach without spending hours glued to your screen.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                To democratize professional-grade social media management. Whether you're a solo creator or a scaling agency,
                Crixen gives you the tools to compete with big brands.
